***Example****
- Let me give you the example I got from my teacher when I entered into my first class of Open Source
 "Imagine of a restaurant having a open soup policy.In that restaurant the chef instead of a waiter will come to you with a menu but the menu doesn’t contain only the name of the soup but also the recipe of it.
Now you can have all the ingredients of the soup or you can also ask for modification(addition or reduction of ingredients )  according to your taste.
that's what open source is according to ***Sunil Kumar Sir***.
