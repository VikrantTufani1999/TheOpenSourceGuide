When you don't want to mess with other's work in the main line of work then you shift a little bit to other path (called branches), where you can work the way without worrying about breaking other's code.

## Branching in nutshell
Git stores commit as snapshot of the difference of last commit and with that information about the author like, email, name, time, commit number and other information. Default branch of Git is **master**.

## Creating a new branch
When you create a branch then the pointer is shifted to that branch and from that branch commit history is bring stored.<br>
**Creating a new branch**<br>
```
git branch branch-name
```

Here you can see that the HEAD is still at master after making testing branch , because we have to do implicitly using commands.<br>
<br>
But when you check which branch you are working on, it will show **master**. Use the command below to check your branch.

```
git branch 
```
For going to branch you made, and working init, you will need to **checkout** to it and then work according.
```
git checkout branch-name
```

You can also use the command below to **make and checkout the branch directly**
```
git checkout -b branch-name
```
You can make as many branch you want according to the number of developers you have. You can also check which **commit has been made in which branch** using :
```
git log
```
If you make commit in **master** after making you branch-name (testing), you will find graph like this :

## Git Merging 
You have done your work in branch and now you want to merge it to the master branch, What will you need?<br>
Here comes **merging** when you move back to master and then merge you branch. It's not necessarily that you will want to merge you any branch to master only but you can merge to other branch also. ***You just need to remember is that : you need to checout to the branch into which you want to merge the branch you have created/ worked on***.<br>
```
git merge testing
 ```

 ***Here they have commited another branch iss53, to master.***
